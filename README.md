# Calendar

A couple of months ago I posted a tutorial about building an interactive calendar using python and PyQt5. The project incorporated two separate GUI's in two different files. One was for the calendar and appointments display. The other was the input form for adding new appointments. I'd been using this multi-GUI setup on most of my projects for about a year now.
